## 💡 Idea Behind the Logo

The logo is designed to reflect clarity, simplicity, and modern design — keeping the DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) theme in mind.

- **Color Scheme**:
  - Dark mode: Optimized for better visibility on dark themes.
  - Transparent version: For flexible use on different backgrounds.
  - Main: Clean and professional look.

- **Symbolism**:
  - The structure and layout represent branching logic and systematic flow — core principles of DSA.

# DSAMate Logo Submission by Mevish

This is my logo submission for DSAMate, designed to reflect simplicity, clarity, and emotional connection with the user.

## ðŸ’¡ Concept

DSAMate is more than just a tool â€” it's like a person who is always with you.  
Whenever youâ€™re stuck or need support, DSAMate is there to help.  
It grows with you, and helps **you grow day by day** â€” just like a true companion on your DSA journey.

This idea is reflected in the design using cozy tones, calm elements, and a welcoming visual style.

## ðŸŒ“ Theme Support

- Light mode logo: `DSA_Mate_lightmode.png`
- Dark mode logo: `DSA_Mate_darkmode.png`

## ðŸ§© Favicon Variants

To support platform integration, Iâ€™ve added favicons in the following sizes:

- `favicon-dark(16x16).png`
- `favicon-dark(32x32).png`
- `favicon-light(16x16).png`
- `favicon-light(32x32).png`

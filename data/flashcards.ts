  },
  {
    id: 3,
    term: "O(log n) - Logarithmic Time",
    explanation: "Time grows logarithmically with input size. Common in divide-and-conquer algorithms like binary search, balanced tree operations.",

  },

  // Recursion
  {
    id: 15,
    term: "Recursion",
    explanation: "Problem-solving technique where function calls itself with smaller subproblems. Requires base case and recursive case. Can lead to stack overflow if not properly bounded.",
